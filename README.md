# Momentum Trading Strategy & Performance Evaluation

Price Oscillator is crossovers of two moving averages correspond to crossovers of price oscillator and zero central signal line around it oscillates. We are interested in momentum by taking short range and long range EMAs and price oscillator is: (ema(short) — ema(long)) / ema(long). So, essentially, we’re looking at the short-term average as a fraction of the long-term average; hence, price oscillator. Moreover, because the price oscillates between two EMAs, we are able to compare movements through different time frames.

Thus, we shall use an oscillating indicator to find signals and in some respect, this could very well be termed as momentum strategy, quite similar to momentum in quantum physics. The underlying principle for momentum trading is to buy high and sell higher and vice-versa. Well known investor Richard Driehaus started the disruption in trading by introducing momentum against the conventional buy low & sell high. Momentum strategy encourages buy high and sell higher going in for trend line.
We will experiment with SP e-mini futures index with 15 min frequency data set and develop a PnL strategy with absolute price oscillator.
